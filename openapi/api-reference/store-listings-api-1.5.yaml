        ## Introduction and Use Case
        The **Store Listings** API was created for developers to **retrieve seller storefront listings** with deep granularity into the **product listing variants**. These real-time insights are typically used for:
        - Discovering item-level product attributes by seller
        - Targeting sellers to your marketplace based on their inventory
        - Conducting market and product research for business development

        ## API Overview

        **Store Listings** is a synchronous API endpoint that gets the sellers’ store listings. This API also allows users to retrieve seller storefront listings including the product listing variants, if they are being offered by the seller requested.

        If the store listings have not been called from the Algopix database, the results will show no listings exist until a background process extracts the seller’s store data, and prepares the data for the API. This guarantees the most updated seller store data.

        > ### Note:
        >
        > **The background process can take up to 24 hours to run, so you will need to make the call again to see results.**

        The maximum amount of Amazon storefront listings that can be retrieved is limited to 2,400 items. However, with the addition of variations and the listings that do not appear in the seller storefront, the number of listings associated with the seller can reach up to 0.5M products.

        The associated API schemas can be found [here](https://github.com/Algopix-team/Algopix-API-schemas/blob/master/openapi/api-reference/store-listings-api-1.5.yaml).

A seller ID (or sometimes called merchant ID) is a publicly available ID number that identifies a storefront and the products sold on Amazon and is unique to the region.

Alternatively, the seller ID can be sourced by using the [Buy Box Owners API](./b3A6MTgxMDkwMDI-request-buy-box-owners).'
